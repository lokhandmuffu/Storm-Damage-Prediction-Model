# Storm-Damage-Prediction-Model Abstract

In the current era, households, businesses, and industries have become extremely dependent on the reliable supply of electric power. Whereas developed nations have well-functioning electricity grids under normal circumstances, these grids experience significant damages during extreme weather conditions like hurricanes and storms, hindering their ability to serve customers. Hence, it is essential for power companies to accurately predict such storm damages to prepare remedial plans to restore power to their customers as soon as possible. Power loss due to storms is a recurring problem in Nova Scotia that affects hundreds of thousands of households every year. Nova Scotia Power Inc. (NSPI), the largest electricity provider in the province, currently uses a simple regression-based tool to predict storm damage based on weather forecasts, which suffers from low accuracy and requires regular manual adjustments. This project aims to develop an advanced tool for storm damage prediction in Nova Scotia based on modern machine learning techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF). The prediction models are trained using historical data of weather and the damage caused during storms and hurricanes in the past and are found capable of predicting outages with a mean absolute error of 0.05 (i.e., the accuracy of 95%), outperforming by a wide margin the tool currently used by NSPI.
